# BetterSearchAgent
A better Willhaben Search Agent, because theirs sucks.
For now, all this does is print an array with new stuff to the console. Enter a willhaben URL (with http/s:// ...). The program will then refresh automatically and grab the newest items on sale, which then get put into an array.
